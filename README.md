## Notes
Quirks encountered will be a jumbled mess here until I decide to fix them:
1. **Fonts and Kitty**: I use Fira Code and symbols from Nerd Fonts. The FAQ for Kitty says to not used any patched fonts as they destroys them. However, in my experience (cross referenced with an Alacritty setup), using patched fonts actually gives *intended* behavior. Using `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` and symbol mapping it in Kitty seems to screw up the sizes of many symbols.
